# Case-Study-TimeSeriesAnalysis-
Summary of the Project

Data Gathering
Data Processing using Fundamental libraries(pandas,numpy)
Checking if the data is stationary or Seasonal as per the time series data concepts
P-value calculated using Dickey-Fuller test whic came out to be less than 0.5 so data is stationary
After that checking Seasonality using decomposition we found data to be seasonal so we will be using SARIMA MODEL to fit our Time series data
Modelling the final dataFrame say(dff) and Predicting the production value for the year 2023 for each month which is stored in the DataFrame FINAL_PRED
